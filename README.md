Chrome APK Packager is a convenient way to produce Chrome ARChon Custom Runtime packages directly from your phone.

You can generate chrome packages from either APKs on your phones storage, or from apps installed on your phone (It will pull APK)

Open the App, select an APK or App from list. App Name and package name are both pulled from the APK and put into the manifest.json file. Everything is then zipped together in a ChromeAPK folder on your phones storage.

Requires https://github.com/vladikoff/chromeos-apk/blob/master/archon.md ARChon Custom Runtime which allows for "unlimited" number of android apps to be installed. (Google Runtime is limited to 4 apps.)
